- **cd command** → Used to change directory.  
- **ps command** → Shows the currently running processes, but not real-time resource usage.  
- **kill command** → Used to terminate (kill) a process.  
- **top command** → Displays all running processes in *real-time*, along with CPU and Memory usage.  
  - Perfect command to identify which process is consuming unusually high system resources.
